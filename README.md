## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
How about a straightforward, user-friendly app where you type in your location and it instantly shows you the nearest e-waste recycling centers or drop-off points? It could also provide basic guidance on how to prepare your electronics for recycling. This way, people can easily find convenient and responsible ways to dispose of their old gadgets, promoting environmental sustainability and reducing electronic waste pollution.
